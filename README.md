Roman To Decimal
================

## Problem description

Write a function to convert from Roman Numerals to decimal numerals.

Roman numerals use combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet to signify values. 
This is the conversion value table:

| Symbol  | Value    |
| ------- | -------- |
| I       |    1     |
| V       |    5     |
| X       |   10     |
| L       |   50     |
| C       |  100     |
| D       |  500     |
| M       | 1000     |

Numbers are formed by combining symbols together and adding or substracting their values. 
Generally, symbols are placed in order of value, 
starting with the largest ones. 
When smaller values precede larger values, 
the smaller values are subtracted from the larger values, 
and the result is added to the total. 

Example:

| Roman Number  | Computation                                    | Value      
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------
| MMCCLVI       |   1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 50 + 5 + 1         | 2256 
| MCMXLIV       |   1000 + (1000 - 100) + (50 - 10) + (5 - 1)    | 1944
