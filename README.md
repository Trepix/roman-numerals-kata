Roman To Decimal
================

## Introduction (Step 0)

**The main focus of this kata is to write a function to convert from Roman Numerals to Decimal Numerals.**

Roman numerals use combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet to signify values. 
This is the conversion values table:

| Symbol  | Value    |
| ------- | -------- |
| I       |    1     |
| V       |    5     |
| X       |   10     |
| L       |   50     |
| C       |  100     |
| D       |  500     |
| M       | 1000     |


Numbers are formed by combining symbols together. 

Example:

| Roman Number  | Computation                                    | Value      
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------
| MMCCLVI       |   1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 50 + 5 + 1         | 2256 


To avoid further complexity in early stages, assume that the number is always valid and forget any issue related to malformed numbers or invalid sequences. 

## Steps

To avoid unnatural solutions compared to your usual development, we have hidden the steps in various documents. First solve the problem presented in each document **before to advancing to the next step**.
