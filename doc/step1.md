# Step 1

Change your implementation of how you manage decimal values. If you use `java.lang.Integer` change it for `java.lang.Number` or even better, `java.math.BigInteger`.

Change your implementation of how you manage number symbols. If you use `java.lang.String` change it for `java.lang.Character`

- How many tests did you have to change?
- How much code did you have to refactor?
- Reflect on why you had to change your code (if you had to).
- Are your tests robust?
- Do you know about ValueObjects?
